# View Channel

A simple example viewing a channel with `phenixWebsiteDemo` token using the Phenix WebSDK v2 APIs for channels.

## Run
1. Open our [hosted example](https://phenixrts.com/examples/ChannelViewer2).
2. (alternatively) Open index.html in a browser.
3. If you want to test it with your stream, just put your token as a query parameter to the browser url `?token=<your token here>`

## Limitations:
* Browsers with webRTC support will view the channel in real-time. This includes the most recent versions of most popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera).
* Legacy browsers will fall back to live streaming (8+ seconds of latency).
